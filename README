apt-swift
------

Additional "swift" protocol for apt so you can host your giant apt repository in Openstack swift

apt is a great packaging system and Openstack swift is a great place to backup/store static files.  apt-swift is especially useful and fast if you are hosting your servers within Openstack.

* Makefile
* Package up binaries
* Explain this a little more

This has to be compiled with the source version of apt.

Once compiled, the resulting swift binary must be placed in /usr/lib/apt/methods/ along with the other protocol binaries.

Finally, this is how you add it to the /etc/apt/sources.list file:

deb swift://username:[password]@openstack-host/version/container prod main

Simply upload all of your .deb packages and Packages.gz file into the Openstack swift container you chose with the file key mapping that matches the file system layout.
